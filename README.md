# Advent-Of-Code-2022

These are my solutions for (Advent of Code 2022)[https://adventofcode.com] in python.  This was really fun!! I learned a lot, especially about python data structures and pathfinding/search algorithms.

I generally didn't keep my part 1 solutions, which I probably should've, unless the code quality was significantly better than the part 2 solution. Also, all the paths are for the specific folder so I don't know that might mess something up

Don't worry, I didn't publish this until January 1st üëç
